        <!-- Drawable to use as the overall window background.  As of
             {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, this may
             be a selector that uses state_accelerated to pick a non-solid
             color when running on devices that can draw such a bitmap
             with complex compositing on top at 60fps.
             <p>There are a few special considerations to use when setting this
             drawable:
             <ul>
             <li> This information will be used to infer the pixel format
                  for your window's surface.  If the drawable has any
                  non-opaque pixels, your window will be translucent
                  (32 bpp).
             <li> If you want to draw the entire background
                  yourself, you should set this drawable to some solid
                  color that closely matches that background (so the
                  system's preview of your window will match), and
                  then in code manually set your window's background to
                  null so it will not be drawn.
             </ul> -->
